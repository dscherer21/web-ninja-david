David attended the Northwestern University Full Stack Web Development training program in 2018, a 3 month non-degree program, where he learned MERN stack(MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) development. After the Northwestern program, David worked at <a href='https://www.thedifferenceengine.io/' target='_blank'>The Difference Engine</a>(TDE). At TDE, David was assigned to a project called Women in Comedy, a social media site for women that are or want to be comedians and want to connect with like-minded individuals. The orginal site was built in WordPress, but the client wanted something different, so the site we rebuilt from scratch. The technologies that were used on this project were: ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, Redux, Heroku, Docker, and PostGreSQL. After TDE, David worked at Tata Consultancy Services(TCS), where he was contracted out to another client. David was brought on to help the client with an internal software application. The application was being upgraded from React v15 to React v16. The tech stack for the application was: ReactJS, Java, Maven/Gradle, Flux, and MongoDb. David also volunteers his time as a developer to a few Non-profit organizations. David is always on the lookout for new opportunities.Feel free to use the contact page to get in touch him.</p>
